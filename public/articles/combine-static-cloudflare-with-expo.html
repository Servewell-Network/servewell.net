		<h1>Combine Static Cloudflare with Expo</h1>
        <p>This tutorial offers an example of how to combine a static Cloudflare deployment with an Expo app. The goal is to create multiple static pages that can be served by Cloudflare, add React-based interactivity after the each page loads, and have it work both in web browsers and in Android and iOS mobile apps.</p>
        <p>Cloudflare recommends using Workers rather than Pages, so we'll use a worker.</p>
        <p>Cloudflare provides the Wrangler CLI for developing apps. Expo provides their own CLI for developing apps. As of mid-2025, there's no official way to put those together.</p>
        <p>This page as part of <a href="/index.html">ServeWell.Net</a> is being served from a combination of the two, proving that it can be done.</p>
        <p>This tutorial should be updated from time to time.</p>
        <p>This tutorial assumes you have already done the following, which may get their own articles soon.
            <ul>
                <li>Set up a Unix-like development computer. This one uses MacOS.</li>
                <li>Created a Cloudflare account (with a domain, if desired).</li>
                <li>Installed Node.js, because that's assumed by Wrangler and Node.js.</li>
                <li>Created a GitHub repository for your project and installed git.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        To address soon:

                <li>
                    After setting up custom domain on Cloudflare website, it recommends keeping your wrangler config in sync: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#set-up-a-custom-domain-in-your-wrangler-configuration-file
