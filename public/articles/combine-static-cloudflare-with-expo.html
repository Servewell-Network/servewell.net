		<h1>Combine Static Cloudflare with Expo</h1>
        <p>This tutorial offers an example of how to combine a static Cloudflare deployment with an Expo app. The goal is to create multiple static pages that can be served by Cloudflare, add React-based interactivity after the each page loads, and have it work both in web browsers and in Android and iOS mobile apps.</p>
        <p>Cloudflare recommends using Workers rather than Pages, so we'll use a worker.</p>
        <p>Cloudflare provides the Wrangler CLI for developing apps. Expo provides their own CLI for developing apps. As of mid-2025, there's no official way to put those together.</p>
        <p>This page as part of <a href="/index.html">ServeWell.Net</a> is being served from a combination of the two, proving that it can be done.</p>
