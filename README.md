# servewell.net

This should be an app for streamlining the in-person work of caring for and empowering people.

Potential Roadmap Features
- Articles, like on Bible topics or on people I meet, with 
    - layers of sensitivity (private insertions only show up for whom they're intended)
    - optional notifications per section
        - each can be made more or less frequent
        - dismissing one brings up the next, like flash cards
    - comments
    - suggestions
    - reactions
- Lists, like best movies, with
    - ability to re-order
    - votes to re-order
- Tags, like on people
    - on topics of their expertise, their vote counts more
    - and/or can sort by the votes of different tag-groups (e.g., what x-group thinks, what y-group thinks)

Repos
- servewell.net (could be renamed) has MIT (free, open) license for most client-side stuff
